### 🚀 Featured Projects

My portfolio spans a wide range of technical domains, from low-level systems to modern web platforms:

#### 🌐 Networking & Distributed Systems
* **[MPI Chord Protocol](https://github.com/costescunicolas/mpi-chord-protocol)**: An implementation of the CHORD distributed routing protocol using MPI, optimized for logarithmic lookups in identifier rings.
* **[Router Dataplane](https://github.com/costescunicolas/router-dataplane)**: Development of an IPv4 router dataplane, featuring packet forwarding logic, ARP and ICMP protocol handling, and efficient Longest Prefix Match (LPM) lookups.

#### 🧪 Functional Programming (Scala & Haskell)
* **[Lambda Calculus Interpreter](https://github.com/costescunicolas/Lambda-Calculus_Interpreter)**: A robust Lambda Calculus interpreter written in Haskell, capable of AST parsing and $\beta$-reduction.
* **[Database Query Language](https://github.com/costescunicolas/database-query-language)**: An immutable database engine developed in Scala, utilizing a custom DSL for complex data queries.
* **[Barcode Decoder](https://github.com/costescunicolas/barcode-decoder)**: An image processor built in Scala for decoding barcodes from Netpbm formats (PPM/PBM).

#### 💻 Full-Stack Web & Visualization
* **[Alco Market](https://github.com/costescunicolas/alco-market)**: A comprehensive E-commerce platform (MERN Stack) featuring Stripe integration for payments, Redis for caching, and Cloudinary for image management.
* **[Pathfinding Visualizer](https://github.com/costescunicolas/pathfinding-visualizer)**: An interactive React tool for visualizing search algorithms (BFS, DFS, A*) and procedural maze generation.

#### 🎮 Graphics & Game Dev
* **[Chicken Invaders & Ship Editor](https://github.com/costescunicolas/chicken-invaders)**: A classic game clone developed in C++, including an advanced grid-based module for ship construction and engineering validation.
